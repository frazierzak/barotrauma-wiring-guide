		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>Hello, I’m Ecchi’Ki Senpai of Undertow’s Barotrauma discord. I have a fair bit above 1’000 hours played in Barotrauma almost exclusively in the submarine editor. I’ve struggled a lot with Barotrauma’s component system early on as the only documentation available at the time was the game’s source code on Github. I can imagine how difficult it can be to grasp some of Barotrauma’s wiring concept considering the lack of consistency among components and even more so for code illiterates. Those are rather big obstacles to understanding the game’s most complex feature so I will do my best to explain it in its entirety in the following guide. My main source will be the Github source code which can be found here. Due to game being early access and the code changing rapidly, I will not reference every single statement. As such, I will only point out for those who are interested that most of the relevant code can be found here.  I will also use circuits that I made myself to demonstrate the concepts we will be going over in this guide.</p>

		<p>You can reach out to me on the Undertow discord if you find any errors</p>
